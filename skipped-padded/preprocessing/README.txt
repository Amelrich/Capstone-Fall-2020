TS skipped and padded with fourier transform, resulting arrays are in frequency domain

preprocessing_DCT.ipynb:
Timeseries skipped and padded with DCT smoothing, resulting ts in time domain


preprocessing_Synthetic_DCT.ipynb:
Synthetic ts skipped and padded with DCT smoothing, resulting ts in time domain

preprocessing_Synthetic_fourier.ipynb:
Synthetic TS skipped and padded with fourier transform, resulting arrays are in frequency domain

preprocessing_Synthetic.ipynb:
Synthetic ts skipped and padded, simple skipped and padded, resulting ts in time domain

preprocessing.ipynb:
